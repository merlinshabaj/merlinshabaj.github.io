    - adolescent values are also fragile like childish ones, just a little more robust
- pain is valueable and linked to growth
- “When we pursue pain, we are able to _choose_ what pain we bring into our lives. And this choice makes the pain meaningful—and therefore, it is what makes life feel meaningful." 
    - pain is the source of all value in life
    - “To numb ourselve to our pain is to numb ourselves of anything that matters in the world."

    - bringing thinking and feeling brain together 
- _Blue Dot Effect_
    - there is a happiness baseline 
    - sometimes you are above or below but after some time you always find yourself back on the baseline 
    - even when your life drastically changes forever
