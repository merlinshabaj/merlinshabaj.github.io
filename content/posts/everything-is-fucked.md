# Book Thoughts 
### _Everything is fucked,_ Mark Manson
<hr>

### Bullet Points
- god value is your the value that sits at the top of your value hierachy 
- spiritual religions, ideological religions, interpersonal religions
- For the _Human Formula_ no hope is needed
    - “Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person, or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”
- moral development explained by stage child, adolescent, adult (at some point this development is unrelated to age)
    - childish: narcissistic, pleasure guided (e.g. left- or right-wing extremists = childish)
    - adolescent: transactional (e.g. Joscha)
    - adult: virtue oriented
- “-isms” are (ideological) religions (e.g. feminism, communism, etc.)
- hope is destructive, at least it can be
- pain is a constant in human life / humans don't exist without pain
    - only question is whether you engage in it or avoid it 
- "the quality of our lives is determined by the quality of our character, and the quality of our character is determined by our relationship with pain.”
- pursuit of happiness is an avoidance of growth, maturity and virtue
    - it is childish, it treats us and ourselves as means to some emotional end
    - you will never be able to reach pure happiness in your life. 10 out of 10 happiness isn’t attainable
    - Stoics didn’t pursuit happiness, but character, the ability to sustain pain and make appropriate sacrifices
- virtues are forms of practicing antifragility, these principles gain from chaos and adversity, hence the name antifragile
    - adult values are antifragile
    - childish values are fragile
    - adolescent values are also fragile like childish ones, just a little more robust
- pain is valueable and linked to growth
- “When we pursue pain, we are able to _choose_ what pain we bring into our lives. And this choice makes the pain meaningful—and therefore, it is what makes life feel meaningful." 
    - pain is the source of all value in life
    - “To numb ourselves to our pain is to numb ourselves of anything that matters in the world."
- meditation is a way of dealing with pain
    - bringing thinking and feeling brain together 
- _Blue Dot Effect_
    - there is a happiness baseline 
    - sometimes you are above or below but after some time you always find yourself back on the baseline 
    - even when your life drastically changes forever
<br><br>
- human decide with their feelings, hence the name feelings economy
- diversion and innovation are two ways of creating value in the market 
    - innovation: upgrading a pain (e.g. new medicine, heart surgery, internet)
    - diversion: means of avoiding pain (e.g. movie theaters, weekend trips, cocaine)
    - “give the people what they want” works with innovations and is destructive when you give them (too many) diversions
- “If the pursuit of happiness pulls us all back into childishness, then fake freedom conspires to keep us there.”
     - variety doesn’t equal freedom
- only real form of freedom, is throuegh self-limitation
    - pleasure, diversions, variety all never last
    - pain of physical exercise => healthier, stronger body
    - sacrifice of a strong work ethic => more job opportunities, more money, control over one's career
    - willingness to engage in conflict => free you to talk to anyone, align with people, support each other
- most meaningful freedom comes from commitments
    - some things are only attainable by depth, which greater commitment allows for
        - having lived in one place for 50 years (familiarity and intimacy with people and culture)
        - having played the guitar for 20 years (artistic expression)
- fake freedom (ff) demands more, while real freedom (rf) is the conscious decision to live with less
    - _ff_ is addictive (can always have more variety / options), has diminishing return (need more for the same high), sees the world as a transaction, requires the world to conform to your will
    - _ff_ consists mostly of options and variety (means-to-an-end mentality)
    - _rf_ is repetitive and predictable, has increasing returns, sees the world unconditionally, with the only victory being over your own desire, requires nothing besides your own will
- North Korea isn’t free because they can’t choose what music to listen to or which TV channel to watch, but because they can’t choose their sacrifices
- democracy requires citizens of strong maturity and character (you need internal and external sacrifices for democracy)
- Plato identified cycles as well, freedom to tyranny (similarly to Stefan Aarnio in _Hard Times Create Strong Men_)
    - inevitable for democracy to lead to moral decay as they start to indulge in _ff_. Thusly people adopt more childish values, they don’t want to endure pain for the sake of greater freedom, which ends up with people wishing for a strong leader who fixes all the problems—a tyrant.
