### _Canâ€™t Hurt Me,_ David Goggins
<hr>

### Bullet points
- awakening was mental
- all my problems I ever had were mental
    - _Will_ is what you use when waging war against yourself
    - _Will_ is mental
- my core is or was: shy, sensitive, timid


### Thoughts
Throughout my whole life, ever since my awakening, I have been on the lookout to train my _Will_. I knew that _Will_ is a thing that I need in order to grow. With _Will_ I would be able to take complete ownership of my core. <br>
That is the reason why, I started to engage in waking up early, running, training, stretching, cold showers after my awakening.
<br><br>
David Goggins dedicated his life to _Will_. His core is different to my mine, although there are overlappings. 
I understand David, depsite me not knowing him personally he feels pretty familiar to me.
