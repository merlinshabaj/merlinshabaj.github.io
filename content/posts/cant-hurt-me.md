### _Can’t Hurt Me,_ David Goggins
<hr>

### Bullet points
- awakening was mental
- all my problems I ever had were mental
    - _Will_ is what you use when waging war against yourself
    - _Will_ is mental
- my core is or was: shy, sensitive, timid


### Thoughts
Throughout my whole life, ever since my awakening, I have been on the lookout to train my _Will_. I knew that _Will_ is a thing that I need in order to grow. With _Will_ I would be able to take complete ownership of my core. <br>
That is the reason why, I started to engage in waking up early, running, training, stretching, cold showers after my awakening.
<br><br>
David Goggins dedicated his life to _Will_. His core is different to my mine, although there are overlappings. 
I understand David, depsite me not knowing him personally he feels pretty familiar to me. <br>
There is no glory in pursuing _Will_, no one will come and pat you on your back or will be there to admire what you’ve done. Ultimately no one can understand the pain you went through or are going through.
<br><br>
Seeking out pain, embracing it, engaging in it, develops your character in all facets of life. Pain is strongly related to purpose.
<br><br>
Peace is linked to all of that.
