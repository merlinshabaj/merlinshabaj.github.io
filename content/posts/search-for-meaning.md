# Book Summary
### Man’s search for meaning - Viktor Frankl
<hr>

### Most important thoughts:
- suffering is an ineradicable part of life like death
- the only freedom you will always have is the freedom to choose in which way to react to things 
    - Man is self-determined, choosing which one(saint or swine) to become is at your own volition
- the meaning of your life will be completly revealed to you at the end of our life. Similiar to a movie which is made up of thousand upon thousand of pictures, you do not understand the context of a given picture without the pictures before same goes for the end of a movie.
- you can find meaning in these three areas:
    - achievement -> publishing a book,
    - love
    - suffering.
- meaning is individual
- “the salvation of man is through love and in love”
- “I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system."

### Experience in Concentration Camp: 
- you get stripped of everything
    - your achievements
    - your possessions 
    - your dignity
    - your name gets replaced with a number
    - your clothes
    - all of your hair
    - -> you end up being just a body of meat, many things on which you could have built your ego on were worthless in an instant.
- you are around death all the time
- close to starvation
- hard physical labour
- random attacks by guards
- bad and broken clothing including shoes -> dealing with the cold
- sleeping with 9 man in one bed in a non heated room and only having two blankets
- lice 
- swollen limbs(legs in particular) because of cold & labour
- death of people around you was a “casual sight”
- developed apathy
- constantly living on the edge of survival

#### Reactions of prisoners:
- Saints, minority of people behaved like saints despite the conditions and looked out for other people, helped other people etc.
- Swine, a lot of people’s behaviour could be described as decietful, self-serving at the cost of others etc. Some were worse than SS guards (espeacially because some could get becoming a Capos).
- prisoners who lost hope usually underwent the same “procedure” -> first started to embrace carelessnes and apathy, laying in their own feces, urin and losing any interest to move even despite motivating guards. Finally they 
most of the time smoked a cigarette which almost clearly signaled to everyone that he is going to die in next 48 hours. <br>
-> clearly shows the magnitude of meaning.
- Viktor mentioned how he helped other prisoners beat their hopelessnes by finding meaning in their lifes.
- For new arrivals all of the common sights in camp are disgusting and deeply troubling, but over time he gets desensitised and it becomes normality. i.g. stealing shoelaces / shoes from a person that has just died became normality.

#### Interesting occurences in camp:
- Spiritual speeches were held
- Prisoners had no sexual lustings, other more important needs weren’t satisfied
- Vikor’s love to his wife, he felt a spiritual connection to her 

### My thoughts:
- Everything that can be stripped away from you like they did with new arrivals in Auschwitz is not qualified to be a source of self-esteem.
- Concentration Camp show the real/pure strength in people. When you can’t inflate your “strength" with physicality, reputation, money etc. you can see your true strength. <br>
-> true strength is important, these outer qualities aren’t pure.<br><br>
This means when judging yourself you should strip yourself of any of these tainted qualities, to see your real form. (recall Meditations)

# Extended summary:
In this summary I am going to start with significant experiences he had in the concentration camps, then go on and explain how prisoners reacted and conclude with his most important thoughts.

**Experiences in the concentration camps**

Upon arrival all new prisoners get stripped of everything they possess except some clothes. Additionally they shave off all the hair of everyone and replace their names with numbers. Thusly this means that often a lot and sometimes everything they used to build up their egos e.g. reputation, financial success or diplomas held no worth in an instant. At this point they were mere human bodies / flesh. 
Afterwards a normal day in the camp looked like the following, first they are woken up by a shrill whistle and have to gather in outside of their huts, where they then began the march to their workplace. They underwent hard physical labour in the cold with insufficient clothes and tools. The daily food they got was a little bread and little bit of watery soup once a day. In addition to that every minor misbehaviour got punished severely by the guards and sometimes they beat up prisoners for no reason. Furthermore they shared one bed and two blankets with nine men in a non heated room and suffered from lice. 
The sight of dead people and prisoners getting beaten up was a normal one in the camp, which desensitised the prisoners. Besides that they also had to deal with diseases, inflammations and swollen limbs because of the cold and hard labour. Generally it was not a good idea to be spotted as handicapped by the guards which could render you useless and ultimately lead to death. 

**Reactions of prisoners**

Frankl observed two kinds of prisoner, the first one being a saint and the second one be a swine. 
On the one hand the people he used to describe as saints were people who despite their hardship still tried to be good, helped other people etc. On the other hand swine were people which behaviour was deceitful, self-serving at the cost of others etc. Some of these people were worse than SS guards, especially if they became a Capo (a prisoner who was assigned to supervise labour and other tasks). Some of the Capos abused the prisoners even more than the SS itself.

Other than that he observed a pattern in prisoners who lost hope and saw no purpose in their suffering anymore. 
Beginning with increasing carelessness and apathy these prisoners stopped moving usually they would stay in bed, not eat and would not even stand up to go to the toilet. As soon as these people smoked a cigarette the prisoners around would know that they would die within the next 48 hours.

Viktor also mentioned cases in which he helped such people overcome this kind of hopelessness by discovering a meaning for their life, which had drastic effects on their mental health. 
(“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” Friedrich Nietzsche)

**Conclusions and  Thoughts**

Viktor Frankl comes to the conclusion that the only freedom you have is the freedom to choose how to react to things. Ultimately Man is self-determined, choosing to become a saint or swine in the context of the concentration camp is at your own volition. 
He also concludes that meaning is individual and unique to each person specifically. Moreover he says that the meaning of life always changes but never ceases to exist. Meaning can be found in three areas: achievement, love and suffering.

Meaning through achievement can be found by creating a work or doing a deed. 
Meaning through love can be found by encountering someone or experiencing something.
Meaning through suffering can be found by the attitude we take toward these unavoidable situations.
