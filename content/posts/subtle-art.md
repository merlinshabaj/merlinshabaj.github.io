# Book Summary
### The Subtle Art of Not giving a Fuck - Mark Manson
<hr>

### Most important thoughts:
- the values you set for yourself determine which fucks you give — what you care about
- emotions shouldn’t be surpressed they offer you deeper insight into your mind
    - values
    - subconscious 
    - deficiencies
- suffering is the source of most profound happiness 
    - can’t avoid suffering and death
- backwards law
- you are not special 
    - being colloquially speaking average isn’t bad (weird concept—makes sense to some degree)


### Some of His Values:
- take 100% responsibility for your life
    - responsibility does not equal fault
    - takes away the room for excuses, blame, entitlement
    - puts you in a position of full leadership over your own life
- look death into the eye
    - death is a part of life 
    - similar to stoic philosophy
- question yourself — you are wrong
    - "what if I am wrong?”, “What would be the consequence of me being wrong?”, “Would me being wrong create a better or worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?"
- being honest
    - american vs. russian culture of honesty
- rejecting alternatives in terms of commitment 
    - rejection of alternatives liberates
    - reject what doesn’t align with most important values 
    - rejection of constant pursuit of breadth without depth
    - though breadth has it’s place as well but depth is where the gold is buried
- “do something” principle
    -  similar to jordan peterson cleaning up your room 
    - if you lack energy or direction start by doing something, doesn’t matter what it is, you will accumalate energy and move forward
    - motivation shouldn’t be looked at like this: <br>
Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action but rather like this: <br>
Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation it is about the reaction of the action that makes you move forward and ellicits the felling of motivation
