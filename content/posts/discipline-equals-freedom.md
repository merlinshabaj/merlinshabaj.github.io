# Book Thoughts
### _Discipline Equals Freedom,_ Jocko Willink
<hr>

I am going to refer solely to the first part of the book, since this is the part about philosophy.

### Thoughts
Generally speaking you can say that his philosophy is close to my personal philosophy of _Will_ and that there are many overlapping points. 
<br><br>
By reading this book I got a better understanding of my own philosphy regarding _Will_ and could refine some concepts. <br>
In one instance he made me understand that knowledge must be a part of excercising in _Will_.<br>
<br><br>
Interesting concepts:
- The count is zero
    - each day you start at zero, which leaves you less room for excuses and weakness
- being aggressive / proactive
    - not meant in a people attacking way but in a weakness attacking way
    - attacking your weakness relentlessly and always striving / seeking out to tackle your weaknesses
- “The truth is what makes discipline unavoidable.”

##### Recommendation
Although this book is almost written in a way where the focus lies on motivating the reader, I think the first part is a good read to gain a **partial** overview of my own principle of _Will_.<br>
The second part isn't a good read.
