Even when my story began and I started to go for runs in the morning, at some point I trained my kicking ability and watched a lot of videos about learning martial arts. <br> Until now I have always had the thoughts of competing officially in martial arts. I wrestled and did boxing with Leon, Hadi and even with Marlon (primarily boxing). Currently and for the pasts months I am consuming a lot of UFC content, I am interested in fighters stories and the adversity they overcome. In addition to that people like David Goggins possess the same “warrior” traits, I am intrigued by. The book “Relentless” inspires / awakens the same in me. So far running has served to this desire or was a substitution for fighting, because it invokes the same feeling in me. Running is also a hard fight with myself, a battle in my mind, a constant doubt whether to quit or to keep running / fighting and enduring the pain and hardship. This is something that makes me <strong>feel alive</strong> like no other thing in my life. Everytime I go for a run it is a test of mental strength and fortitude. But I think it isn’t as hard as fighting and does not challenge me in the same way as fighting would. Fighting is the ultimate display of mental fortitude, it involves a lot more pain, it is faster paced meaning you always have to keep your mental fortitude up and can never let down even for a second -> extremely high form of mindfulness. If won a fight, you go home with a victory unlike running where you can always do more, even when you score a new personal best being extremely exhausted, I think it doesn’t translate the same like a bloody fight, a war. Fighting goes deeper, it hits your human core and thusly conveys a feeling even the most beautiful tragedy couldn’t convey. It makes me cry, become emotional but also makes me strong, and unstoppable at the same time. Fighting builds up emotion and releases emotion in fluent, natural way -> this makes you feel alive. It is a huge source of strength. I can’t get the same from running.<br> The desire to step in the cage and express and let out exactly these emotions.<br> <code>CONTENT BELOW WAS DELETED ONCE. THIS IS JUST AN APPROXIMATION OF IT:</code><br> I know that I have a talent for this, throwing myself into the fire and coming out stronger. And not only that it also strengthens and fosters this natural ability / talent of mine. And in my everyday life this constant desire to do that isn’t satisfied. Even though I am already doing things that nobody else is doing and with that means that I am alone on my path and have to create the path in the first place which also needs a fair portion of mental fortitude. Nontheless it can not be compared to fighting - so far running is the activity that comes the closest to it.<br> <code>END OF DELETED CONTENT</code><br> The story of being this fighter, this Rocky type of guy, being in extreme adversity and overcoming it, is a wonderful story, which I to some degree already live but which I would also like to foster even more and fighting is the thing that can accomplish that in the right way. I love to indulge in exactly that, it is beautiful.<h3 id=update-4th-of-december>Update 4th of December</h3><p>Last week I went for a 34km run, the longest distance I’ve ever run so far and a 13km jump from the second longest distance I’ve ever run. This run was extremely challenging and I would say I exactly tapped into the my core with all of the emotions described above. <br> This means it is possible to tap into that with just running. <br> Furthermore I disagree with what I said regarding, that running is open ended and fighting isn’t, both are open ended. I don’t think I could ever feel complete after a fight, for longer than just a moment. Same goes for running. <br><br> I completly forgot about that and in a recent note I talked about exactly these emotions, just to find them already written down here. Even though I didn't have the experience back then, I perfectly anticipated how this would play out.<br></section></article></main></div>
