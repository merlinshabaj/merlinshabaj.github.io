(recall Meditations)</ul><h1 id=extended-summary>Extended summary:</h1><p>In this summary I am going to start with significant experiences he had in the concentration camps, then go on and explain how prisoners reacted and conclude with his most important thoughts.<p><strong>Experiences in the concentration camps</strong><p>Upon arrival all new prisoners get stripped of everything they possess, except for some clothes. Additionally they shave off all the hair of everyone and replace their names with numbers. Thusly this means that often a lot and sometimes everything they used to build up their egos e.g. reputation, financial success or diplomas held no worth anymore, in an instant. At this point they were mere human bodies / flesh. Afterwards a normal day in the camp looked like the following: first they are woken up by a shrill whistle and have to gather outside of their huts, where they then began the march to their workplace. They underwent hard physical labour in the cold with insufficient clothes and tools. The daily food they got was a little piece of bread and little bit of watery soup once a day. In addition to that, every minor misbehaviour got punished severely by the guards and sometimes they beat up prisoners for no reason. Furthermore, they shared one bed and two blankets with nine men in a non-heated room and suffered from lice. The sight of dead people and prisoners getting beaten up was a normal one in the camp, which desensitized the prisoners. Besides that they also had to deal with diseases, inflammations and swollen limbs because of the cold and hard labour. Generally, it was not a good to be spotted as handicapped by the guards which could render you useless and ultimately lead to death.<p><strong>Reactions of prisoners</strong><p>Frankl observed two kinds of prisoner, the first one being a saint and the second one being a swine. On the one hand the people he used to describe as saints were people who, despite their hardship, still tried to be good, helped other people etc. On the other hand, swine were people whose behaviour was deceitful, self-serving at the cost of others etc. Some of these people were worse than SS guards, especially if they became a Capo (a prisoner who was assigned to supervise labour and other tasks). Some of the Capos abused the prisoners even more than the SS itself.<p>Other than that he observed a pattern in prisoners who lost hope and saw no purpose in their suffering anymore. Beginning with increasing carelessness and apathy these prisoners stopped moving usually they would stay in bed, not eat and would not even stand up to go to the toilet. As soon as these people smoked a cigarette the prisoners around would know that they would die within the next 48 hours.<p>Viktor also mentioned cases in which he helped such people overcome this kind of hopelessness by discovering a meaning for their life, which had drastic effects on their mental health. (“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” Friedrich Nietzsche)<p><strong>Conclusions and Thoughts</strong><p>Viktor Frankl comes to the conclusion that the only freedom you have is the freedom to choose how to react to things. Ultimately Man is self-determined, choosing to become a saint or swine in the context of the concentration camp is at your own volition. He also concludes that meaning is individual and unique to each person specifically. Moreover he says that the meaning of life always changes but never ceases to exist. Meaning can be found in three areas: achievement, love and suffering.<p>Meaning through achievement can be found by creating a work or doing a deed.<br> Meaning through love can be found by encountering someone or experiencing something.<br> Meaning through suffering can be found by the attitude we take toward these unavoidable situations.<br><p><code>unfinished</code></section></article></main></div>
