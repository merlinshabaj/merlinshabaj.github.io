I knew that <em>Will</em> is a thing that I need in order to grow. With <em>Will</em> I would be able to take complete ownership of my core. <br> That is the reason why, after my awakening, I started to engage in waking up early, running, training, stretching and cold showers. <br><br> David Goggins dedicated his life to <em>Will</em>. His core is different from mine, although there is overlap. I understand David—despite me not knowing him personally he feels pretty familiar to me. <br> There is no glory in pursuing <em>Will</em>, no one will come and pat you on your back or will be there to admire what you’ve done. Ultimately no one can understand the pain you went through or are going through. <br><br> Seeking out pain, embracing it, engaging in it, develops your character in all facets of life. Pain is strongly related to purpose. <br><br> Peace is linked to all of that.</section></article></main></div>
